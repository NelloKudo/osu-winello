# Installation

## Prerequisites 

The only real requirement is actually `git`, as the script will install the rest itself.
You can easily get it like this:

**Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install -y git`

**Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -Sy --needed  --noconfirm git`

**Fedora:** `sudo dnf install -y git`

**openSUSE:** `sudo zypper install -y git`

## PipeWire:

`PipeWire` **isn't really a dependency but is highly recommended, especially with this script.**

You can install it like this:

### Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS etc..):

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y pipewire libspa-0.2-bluetooth pipewire-audio-client-libraries
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/wireplumber-upstream
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install -y wireplumber
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user mask pulseaudio
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse
```

### Arch Linux (Manjaro, Endeavour OS, etc.):
  
**Remove PulseAudio:** `sudo pacman -Rdd pulseaudio`
 
And then:
  
```  
sudo pacman -Sy --needed --noconfirm pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa wireplumber
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire.service pipewire.socket pipewire-media-session.service pipewire-pulse.service pipewire-pulse.socket
``` 

Manjaro users can instead use their distro's package: `sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm manjaro-pipewire`
 
### Fedora:
 
**Fedora's latest versions already ship with Pipewire ; you might want to check with this:**
  
```   
sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils
pactl info
``` 

Rebooting your system is recommended e.e

### openSUSE (Tumbleweed, Leap):

```
sudo zypper install pipewire-pulseaudio
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire wireplumber
```
These commands will install the `pipewire-pulseaudio` and `wireplumber-audio` packages.

If pulseaudio is installed, zypper will warn you with a message. You should choose "Solution 1" to deinstall pulseaudio.

**Since the 20220708 openSUSE Tumbleweed release, new installations use PipeWire as the default audio engine instead of PulseAudio**

**Note that a system upgrade from a previous openSUSE Tumbleweed release won't automatically replace PulseAudio, so you might enable and use PipeWire by yourself**

Rebooting your system is highly recommended. After rebooting you might want to check if PipeWire is working:

```
pactl info | grep "Server Name"
```

## Installing osu!:
```
git clone https://github.com/NelloKudo/osu-winello.git
cd osu-winello
chmod +x ./osu-winello.sh
./osu-winello.sh

## OR

./osu-winello.sh --basic #if you want a clean install without tweaks (advanced)
```

You can now launch osu! with:
```osu-wine```

**WARNING: you might need to close and relaunch your terminal to use the command.**

__General recommendations__: use -40/35ms offset to make up for Wine (or -25 if you're using audio compatibility mode)

# Features:

- installs every needed wine dependency by itself (for distros using apt, pacman and dnf)
- comes with utilities like osu-handler, Discord RPC (winestreamproxy) and native support for Linux file managers!
- uses patched [wine-osu](https://gist.github.com/NelloKudo/b6f6d48807548bd3cacd3018a1cadef5) binaries with the latest community patches, you can read more [here](https://gist.github.com/NelloKudo/b6f6d48807548bd3cacd3018a1cadef5) and support updates according to the repo!
- installs osu! on either default or custom path (using GUI) 
- integrates with both already existing osu! installations from Windows or with [diamondburned's osu-wine](https://gitlab.com/osu-wine/osu-wine)
- skips the pain of downloading prefix stuff thanks to [my fork](https://gitlab.com/NelloKudo/osu-winello-prefix) of [osu-wineprefix](https://gitlab.com/osu-wine/osu-wineprefix)
- support for installing Windows fonts (fix for Japanese and special characters)
- support for old distros too! (binaries built on GLIBC 2.27)
- lutris support

This script is based on the [guide](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1248084?n=1) I've written on the osu! website: more troubleshooting on the game itself can be found there e.e

```

# Steam Deck Support

Since osu! runs on Wine, you can play that on Steam Deck as well!

It is recommended to not manually install pipewire on the Steam Deck as it is already installed by default and attempting to do so may cause audio issues in gaming mode.

Before using the script, make sure to:
- Set a password using the `passwd` command
- Disable read-only filesystem with `sudo steamos-readonly disable`

If you need help with pacman or just want reliable info, check these two links: [Link 1](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C) -- [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/t8al0i/install_arch_packages_on_your_steam_deck/)

The script will handle the rest itself, but you might need to reinstall dependencies after every Deck update (read more [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C)); you can simply do that with:

```osu-wine --fixsteamdeck```
